# Resume

- Code that reads a datasheet (.xlsx file) of predetermined format to calculate gains and losses of transactions with criptocoins

# TO DO

- Verify divergence between code and manual log results of type 3 operations
- Verify use of time interval to calculate gains and losses inside given interval
- Once ready, expand to other classes of assets (the main objective of this code is for cripto transactions)
- Write contability of gains and losses

# Contability of gains and losses

- FIFO (first in first out)

# Dependencies

- https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs


# Observations

- The parser code must run before the application, so the json files are ready beforehand
