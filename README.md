# Resume

- Cryptos: Reads a datasheet (.xlsx file) of predetermined format to calculate gains, losses and summary of transactions with criptocoins
- Finances: Stores the log of general transactions (e.g. salary, groceries shops...) one each time (This is part of a project of the Rocketseat Maratona Discovery - https://app.rocketseat.com.br/node/maratona-discover-edicao-01, adapted with some modifications)
